📋 Action Plan (Prioritized)
Quick Wins (Do These First):

✅ Increase EPOCHS from 2 to 4-5 (5 minutes)

✅ Adjust class weights - boost Depression and Suicidal (10 minutes)

✅ Try learning rate 3e-5 or 5e-5 (30 minutes)

Medium Effort (If quick wins don't work):

⚙️ Implement Focal Loss (30 minutes)

⚙️ Add text augmentation (1 hour)

⚙️ Try RoBERTa instead of DistilBERT (1 hour)

Advanced (If you want 90%+ accuracy):

🔬 Build ensemble of 3 models (2-3 hours)

🔬 Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna (3-4 hours)
